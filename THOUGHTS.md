## DB Layer

Bare bones of what I'll need:

- Employee
- Timeslot (employee availability)
- User
- Appointments

Questions:

- What calendar scopes do we plan on supporting? i.e. if day only view, easier than month view, etc? How granular with times?

- What about recurring availability? Is that handled cleverly by some design choice?

- What about "orphaned" or "past" one-off timeslots?
